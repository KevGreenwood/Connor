**Connor** was born from the remnants of my previous project, *PrometheusActivator*.

It is a Windows application that allows you to manage and block **inbound and outbound Windows Firewall rules** for specific programs through a clean and modern interface built with **WPF UI**.

Connor is designed to help you:
- Control application network access
- Improve privacy and reduce telemetry
- Work with software that relies heavily on online validation or network-dependent features

All wrapped in a simple, elegant, and user-friendly experience.

### Happy fire blocking 🔥
